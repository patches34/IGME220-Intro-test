# Consider 320 though
notes: Here, I want to mention something about the question i've had on each of the assignments. "How would you digitize this?"

# Functionality, Completeness, and Balance
## Chapter 10 - GDW

## The missing masses of playtesting
notes: this chapter focuses on the next steps after getting your game prototyped. You've essentially moved from getting your game on paper and then finally getting to the place where you no longer are iterating and poking at what a game is, but the details required to get that game to market.

notes: So, up until this time, we've been stuck sort of in, "Where do game ideas come from?" And through that, we've got to worry about editing, prototyping, and things. For Assignment 5, your final assignment, we'll be getting the games from ideation to around pre-production, "a stable idea that can be further developed and published."

notes: Note that in the ideation phase here there isn't a lot of playtesting. Playtesting begins once you have refined your initial idea. Many games never leave the ideation phase, fewer games never leave preproduction. In fact, there is a significant amount of the game industry that has a ton of failed preproduction projects, some 10 years or more without a shipped game. That's just the way it goes. The key here is that your capacity to figure out what games can and cannot work is a skill related to what we are developing here in 220 and 320.

## A Rant About Balance
notes: I am not a person who believes in balance. To me, game balance is a symptom of a larger problem of humanity wherein it cannot handle self-criticism. We all balk when we are under the gaze of criticism. We have reputations that hinder folks talking to us. We miss connections. We miss larger problems. Instead, we seek solace in the comfortable, in the routine, in the pleasure of the known. Balance, game balance from a player's perspective explicitly, are all those things. As designers, we have to think about balance very differently.

## What is balance?
notes: Balance is a term for a war between creators and consumers. Both sides have different approaches, needs, and desires but in each case, it has to do with power, with the nature of your game, and the experience the players themselves want.
--
### "the process of making sure the game meets the goals you have set for the player experience."
notes: This is where creators begin. We talked recently about emotions for our players but there's going to be a subset of players that absolutely demolish your game. 
--
### "Few unintended consequences."
notes: And here is where i'll mention speedruns. Mention SummoningSalt
--
### "Fair"
notes: What is fair when there is a power-based relationship. Here is where the "most important event in raiding history" comes around. As students in this program, you are stuck receiving the content we decide is appropriate. Demands for new content will be met (often) with a big, "NO" and you cannot do much about it.
--
## Balance is "Of the time"
notes: Much like our racist uncles, the concept of balance is itself contextually mediated by time. THink about Atari, NES, and SNES games, their balance is all over the place because it wasn't until the 10NES Chip that we had any real quality control. And we talk a lot about "More advanced" as though this matters but in the background are stabilizations, expectations, and demands for quality. It is here that you as designers must exist, often frustratingly so, because while gamers demand fairness, gamers also have expectations of quality that is beyond most studios.
