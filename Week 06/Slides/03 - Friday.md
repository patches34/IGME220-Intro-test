# RPGs - Essential Terms

## TERMS
--
## Session 0
notes: This is a session used to develop the world play will happen on. There are games that are useful to look at here like: Fiasco, Microscope, The Quiet Year, Red Carnations on a Black Grave, Icarus. The goal of these is for everyone to put some part of themselves into the game.

## Campaign vs One-Shot
notes: A campaign is a collection of episodes that are constantly connected. One-shots are generally just getting random folks together to play one game, one night, and never again.
--
## Attributes, Skills, Feats
notes: the big thing that impacted computer-mediated play was how the mathematical aspects of wargames were combined with business-based roleplaying. Here, this is how we design a system to adjudicate disagreements with random distribution based on dice. This metaphorically illustrates the nature of your performance as while we may have an 18 strength, that 18 strength is rarely up to snuff at any given time.

## Crunch and "System Weight"
notes: Depending on the nature and expectation of the system at hand, there is a useful discussion here about just how much of a system is necessary to play a roleplaying game. Crunch refers to how much math is in a system whereas weight is typically reserved for the weight of the system in reference to the intent of play (story-driven vs combat-driven)

## Avatar / Character
notes: This was also a benefit to CRPGs. With imaginative play combining with wargaming, we saw the birth of characters with names that we had stats for. This, in-turn, gave us someone to have an emotional connection to. There is an apocryphal story here about when D&D switched from playing yourselves to playing someone else. While it is unknown if this is true, it is a useful discussion about playing yourself, dying, and then still being alive in the real world vs Gandalf, your character, jumping into a fight with a balrog and falling into a deep chasm.

## ludonarrative dissonance
notes: What the game allows vs what the narrative tells. This has to do with the loss of free will. Mass Effect is an example wherein no matter how much of a renegade or hero Shepard is, the game still regards you as a hero. Or, GTA4 sees you as a guy just trying to become a better human in the city while you also murder relentlessly while driving. Character and narrative are out of balance in a dissonant sort of way. So, for example in ttrpgs, a Paladin in D&D, paragon of virtue, constantly murdering everything in sight. 
--
## What your character knows vs what you know
notes: This is slightly related to the previous item but this is a disconnect about what you know about the world vs what your character should know.  A Good example of this would be the Sherlock Holmes episodes of Star Trek: TNG. 
--
## GMless
notes: These are games where there is some vehicle through which the game world runs itself. They're meant for groups that don't have people who want to DM or for forever DMs to actually play. This is a hugely experimental space. 
--
## Journaling Games
notes: This is a relatively newer idea. You don't really play with others but you do manage to have a journal that outlines your character's progression through whatever the prompt is. For example, "You are becoming a horrific monster, how do you feel?" "You have been a vampire for 1000 years, what's in your journal?"

## x-card and saftey
notes: safety and a way to police that safety.
