--
# <font color= "ffff00">Who</font> is a game designer?
note: Who are your favorite game designers? Why? They are advocates for the user, they use their perspective to advocate for the user. in some circumstances, they are artists. Who would you say are designers that transcend being a bridge between  games and users?
--
# <font color= "ffff00">Why</font> is a game designer?
note: speaking of why, why do we even have a job or career called game designer? History lesson.

# Important Concepts
note: we will begin with Chapter 1 and go through it.

# Game vs Play
note: games are fragile systems and each element is inextricably linked to the others. They are closed, formal systems, that engage players in structured conflict, and resolves its uncertainty in an unequal outcome. Play is figuring out how that system works.
--
# Game Designer
note: The role of the game designer is to be an advocate for the player who continually focuses on the player experience and is not distracted by other shinies or their own ego. They are clear communicators with all members of a design team meaning a game designer has a clear vision of what they see as the game and can present it easily. Note here that communication includes, above all, listening, often under great pressure. In addition to the act of designing, they additionally see the world in all of its half-real glory.

# Definition of videogame
### <font color = "ffff00">Maybe also, just "game"</font>
note: there are lots of these definitions from various places but almost all of them agree in some way, shape, or form.
--
## a rule-based formal system
note: Can you think of games that do not have rules? Can you think of some aspect of life that doesn't have rules? How does a system in the world differ from a system in games?
--
## with variable and quantifiable outcomes
note: Someone has to win. As such, games and balance are often at odds. 
--
## where different outcomes are assigned different values
note: winners, losers, sometimes ties. But also, different games will dictate this. 
--
## where the player exerts effort in order to influence the outcome
note: with a board game, players maintain the game state. In a video game, typically the processor and programming will maintain parts of the game state relevant for players to "live" in.
--
## the player feels emotionally attached to the outcome
note: This is a tricky one but tension is the most normal emotion, ambition, wanting to win. In narrative games, maybe desire to finish narrative.
--
## and the consequences of the activity are optional and negotiable
note: You can always shut the game off. 
--
## Some pertinent quotes:
--
![[/images/slides/hr/1.png]]
note: To play a videogame is therefore to interact with real rules while imagining a fictional world, and a video game is a set of rules as well as a fictional world. 
--

![[2.png]]
note: It is a basic paradox of games that while the rules themselves are generally definite, unambiguous, and easy to use, the enjoyment of a game depends on these easy-to-use rules presenting challenges that cannot be easily overcome.
--
![[3.png]]
note: Where a game is specified as a small number of rules that combine and yield large numbers of game variations for which the player must design strategies to handle. This is found in card and board games, in sports, and in most action and all strategy games.
--
![[/images/slides/hr/4.png]]
note: progression is the historically newer structure that became part of the video game through the adventure genre. In progression games, the player has to perform a predefined set of actions in order to complete the game. One feature of the progression game is taht it yields strong control to the game designer: since the design controls the sequence of events. Progression games are also where we find most games with storytelling ambitions.

note: the rules of a game add meaning and enable actions by setting up differences between potential moves and events.

<!-- slide bg= "[[rogue.png|2000]]" -->
![[images/slides/rogue.png|2000px]]
note: This is rogue. For many of you, you know the term roguelike or roguelite but have never heard of or touched this game. And yet, for many people, this game is the most emotional game they've ever played. What does it mean that this game has emotion attached to it where folks would stalk the developer to demand things be added to help their character? What does it mean that it's so emotional that it's still invoked today yet never really played.3
