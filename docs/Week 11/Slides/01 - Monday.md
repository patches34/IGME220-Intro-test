# Assignment: 
# make a whole ass game
## So now what?
notes: This is a big ask. Design literacy is a new idea, design approaches are new, so....what do we do?

## Emotion > Theme > Mechanic
notes: I had to sort of begin here. But this is mostly to focus you on an idea that itself is immutable. 
--
# So...what?
notes: So...where do we go? How do we do it? What do we do? Why?
--
# This is chapter 6-11 in your textbook.
## But let's summarize.

# Ideation
notes: This sounds like it's just 1 thing but in secret, it's many things. A couple of slices in this image I want to put in here is that while this is mostly devoted to software but here, there isn't much outside of it.

# Prototyping
notes: Here, you all have some issues to work on. Even last week after I said you needed your sell sheet, you all started writing it in class, the day of. Getting things on papers indicates that you are all of one mind, that you have consensus.

# Digital Prototyping
notes: For some of you, this is what you want to do. I get it, video games are the dream! But even for video game companies, they start like we are here. The processes we teach you in the program aren't necessarily related to reality, but are good to know.

# Playtesting vs User Testing vs. Marketing vs QA
notes: These processes are extremely important but extremely confusing because there's never a ton of literature or training on them in game programs.

notes: So we do user testing, market tests, and things as we're getting the game ready. As we shift into having a build, we start playtesting to see what individual users feel about the game. Then, as the game is completed, we start getting closer to QA.

# The Last Mile
## Functionality, Completeness, Balance

# Accessibility - Let's Talk About It

# What is missing?

# During Ideation

## Whiteboard or pen and paper
notes: brainstorm to figure out what you see as the design. Get a list of things together that you need to make the thing work. A list of ingredients. In higher ed, we force you to do this via a GDD and you should always do this but know that GDDs will vary wildly by company, the list will not (and if it isn't present, be afraid, very afraid.)

# Research!
notes: What games is your game like? What can you learn from them? What should you learn from them? What don't you know but need to about how your game works?
--
## How do you find answers?
--
# Play games like what you want.
--
# Find dev diaries, post mortems
## but always listen, observe your life for game ideas
notes: but your answers may come from conversations with people not in game design. This is why i'm constantly telling you to think in terms of real life rather than in the scope of other games.
