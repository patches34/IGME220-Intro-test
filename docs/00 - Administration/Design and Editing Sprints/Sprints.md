Week 1 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Design Sprint #1
The Up the River Exercise.

Welcome to Game Design and Development 1. For those of you who are programmers, we won't be doing that here. For those of you who are artists, you might be able to fit something in here but it'll be quick. We're here to concentrate on pre-production or when the design of a game happens; execution, or programming, is what comes during production. While we will be primarily designing games for physical prototypes, you will be asked to create plans for digitizing your projects. 

This first project is JUST YOU. 

The assignment is this: 

1. Learn how to play the game as is. 
2. Make 3 substantial changes with just 1 being allowed to be art- or theme-based. 
3. Write it up and turn in the following items: 
	* Instruction Manual with your additions.
		* Some of you might be asking about length requirements. If I can't figure out how to play what you've designed, figure it out.
	- Print and Play Files if you add any pieces.
		- This is if you've created a theme, new pieces, or something that requires new participants to do something.
	- Post Mortem - write enough words to answer the following: 
		- What went right?
		- What went wrong?
		- If you could start over, what would you change?
		- What would be the most difficult part of this to digitize?
	- Ideas for further development

Put all of this into a single PDF file these up in a .zip file and submit by Saturday night!

Week 2 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Editing Spring #1
Edit someone else’s Up the River.

Being on a production team, you never really know what you'll get when the team you're on is tasked with a new part of the project. This assignment is meant to simulate that.

This project is JUST YOU. 

In this project, you will be editing someone else's Up the River assignment. Like the previous assignment, you will be adding stuff to the game. The assignment has the following parameters: 

1. Learn how to play the game as you received it. 
2. Make 3 substantial changes with just 1 being art-based. 
	1. You cannot undo someone's changes.
	2. You must add to them with 3 of your own.
	3. If you are changing theme, your mechanical additions must follow
3. Write it up and turn in the following items: 
	* Instruction Manual with your additions.
	- Print and Play Files if you add any pieces.
	- Post Mortem - 250 words
	- How you might digitize this - 250 words

Week 4 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Design Sprint #2
The Frag Experiment

In this assignment, you will BE ASSEMBLING IN GROUPS OF 2 and making an expansion pack for the Steve Jackson game, FRAG. This is an FPS made into a boardgame and it gets into a specific problem we tend to see in IGM, "why am I designing video games with paper?!!?!?"

Many of you want to be writing code and calling it design. Code is execution, not design. This assignment is for you. First-person shooters have a core loop that mostly focuses on shooting and that's typically mediated by the physics engine. The actual design of an FPS depends on special features, movement, and other aspects of the game. So this assignment is born as I want you to see the relationship between the logic of a boardgame versus that of Shooters themselves.

See the following: 
![[FPS Paper.png|350]]![[FPS Digital.png|310]]

You will be making an expansion for the game. It requires the following items In 1 PDF (it doesn't have to be done, but started): 

1. Blank Page with: 
	1. Name of your expansion
	2. Your names
	3. An intro paragraph (flavor text for the back of a box the size of Frag)
2. An instruction book made in the style of the original.
3. Print and play files for your tokens 
4. 5 questions you need an answer to. 

Week 5 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Editing Sprint #2
Finish your expansion

And so now, we have the final part of this assignment. This is where you get things mostly in place and get them to a point where you could put it on your portfolio. This shouldn't be fully polished, but everything should be mostly in first draft form. It should include: 

1. Blank Page (if you wanna do cover art, that's cool too): 
	1. A Name
	2. Your names
	3. An intro paragraph (flavor text for the back of a box the size of Frag)
2. An instruction book made in the style of the original.
3. Print and play files for your tokens and pieces where appropriate.
4. Post Mortem - enough words to answer the following: 
		- What went right?
		- What went wrong?
		- If you could start over, what would you change?
		- What would be the most difficult part of this to digitize?
5. Ideas for further development - 250-500 words

Week 7 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Design Sprint #3
Narrative Game: 200 Word RPG

For this assignment, you will be making a tabletop roleplaying game IN GROUPS OF 3. If I just said words you've never heard before, you will be making a game like Dungeons and Dragons. This assignment was suggeted by Marshall Miller via BlueSky as I talked about how to make this course interesting. From that website: https://200wordrpg.github.io/

>Why 200 Words?

>A 200 word limit encourages creativity and demands the very best of your editing and writing abilities. While making a game in 200 words can be difficult, it’s less of a daunting commitment than editing and proofing 285 pages of rules, complete with art and layout.

>Conceiving, designing, and publishing a 200 word game is a great first step toward completing larger game design projects.

For this game, I want the following items in 1 zip file: 
1. Your file made in Microsoft Word and submitted as a .docx file.
	1. Do not put your name in the file.
2. OPTIONAL: A PDF if you want to be fancy and lay the game out. 

Week 8 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Editing Sprint #3
Narrative Game: Playtest 3 200 Word RPGs

The 3 of you are to play 3 of the entries. For your playtests, I want the following items, per player, per game. So, each person should submit their files separately. The space requirement should reflect thoughtful answers to the questions. These will be shared with the designers of said games.

1. Is this a game you would have played without it being an assignment? Why or why not?
2. What was your favorite part of the session you played?
3. In your opinion, what could be improved in the game?    
4. Were there any mechanical aspects of the game that stood out to you (positive or negative)?  

The Editing Rubric applies here.

Week 09 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Design Sprint #4
Find a game with a sense of tension and add some
mechanics

For this assignment, you will be working in and around tension. YOU WILL BE WORKING IN TEAMS OF 4. The goal of this project is to design a game around a single word: tension. So many games, video games especially, use tension. It could be something like: 

1. A timer
2. Speeding up as score goes up.
3. Precariousness
4. A sound effect
5. Worry about a secret
6. Being a hidden role
7. Balancing something

In video games, these also exist but you can add: 
1. A sound when your health or a timer is low (e.g. Zelda, Gauntlet, Mario Brothers)
2. A slowly darkening screen (e.g. Journey, Gears of War)
3. the sound of a heartbeat beating quickly (e.g. Darkest Dungeon, )
4. Size and damage output (e.g. Soulslike games)

For this assignment, you are going to create a paper prototype of a game with a sense of tension. This can be literally anything your group of 4 can imagine. The difficult part is that your sense of tension needs to carry over from paper to screens. 

You have two weeks to do this. 

For this first week, I want to see where you all are at. Give me the following documents: 

1. Blank Page with: 
	1. Name of your game.
	2. Your names
	3. A 1-sentence description of the core loop of your game.
2. An instruction book.
3. Print and play files. 
4. 5 questions you need an answer to. 

Week 10 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Editing Sprint #4

In your groups of 4, playtest your game, edit, get yourselves in a good place. Or in other words, finish your prototype. You've had all last week and all this week. Now it's time to get it to a place where it can be put to bed. Here is what you need to finish it up: 

1. Blank Page with: 
	1. Name of your game.
	2. Your names
	3. A 1-sentence description of the core loop of your game.
2. An instruction book.
3. Print and play files for your game.
4. Post Mortem - enough words to answer the following: 
		- What went right?
		- What went wrong?
		- If you could start over, what would you change?
		- What would be the most difficult part of this to digitize?
5. Ideas for further development - 250-500 words
6. Digitization Plans: For this, all you really need is to tell me:
	- What platforms or devices will you develop for?
	- What engine will you use and why?
	- What assets will you need?
	- How will the sense of tension you created need to be adjusted for videogaming?
	- What 5 games already exist like this potential project that you'd have to compete with?
		- How will you compete?

Week 11 - Final Game . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Sprint #5
This begins our final Project. Due dates are staggered but the complete game is due during exam week on the last possible day of exam week.

For this assignment, you will make a physical game of your choice. Many of you who will be going on to 320 might consider making a physical prototype that you can digitize later. **THIS WILL BE IN GROUPS OF 5.** In addition, you will also be given 5 whole weeks to make these games and in each of these 5 weeks, I will off you the following: 

1. Playtests will be on Friday, every Friday for 5 weeks.
2. I will open them to other classes if you want more than just us. 
3. If you'd like my input, please let me know on Wednesday.
4. Doing *whatever you want* is additionally a problem because of analysis paralysis. So, i'll offer to help you get your idea going. 

With 5 weeks, i'm expecting a bit more from you all. For example, you can actually have things like graphic design, art direction, and maybe a tiny amount of polish. You will be turning in Milestone 1: 

1. a Pitch Document
2. A mid-point checkin.
3. A final file with everything in the checklist below.
### Pitch Document
1. In your group of 5, get together on Monday and brainstorm some games ideas. 
2. On Wednesday, polish up a 1-page sell sheet for your game idea. 
3. On Friday, meet with the other teams and talk about your games via your sell sheets.
	1. Get at least 3 people to agree to put their name as signatures for your submission. 

The document should be 2 page when you turn it in. 
* Page 1: Administration Page
	* Your names
	* Your game's name
	* Your core loop
	* Your 3 signers
* Page 2: Sell-sheet
	* Sell me your game. 
	* I need to know:
		* what it is, 
		* how it'll work, 
		* and how it differs from games like it. 
### Mid-point checkin: 
This is just a reason for me to get you to do a bit of work on your final deliverable. This document will be the same as the final but i'll just be making sure you've made progress. 

1. Blank Page with: 
	1. Name of your game.
	2. Your names
	3. A 1-sentence description of the core loop of your game.
2. An instruction book.
3. Print and play files for your game.
4. All of your playtest notes, organized with how you used the feedback.
5. Post Mortem - enough words to answer the following: 
		- What went right?
		- What went wrong?
		- If you could start over, what would you change?
		- What would be the most difficult part of this to digitize?
6. Ideas for further development - 250-500 words
7. Digitization Plans: For this, all you really need is to tell me:
	- What platforms or devices will you develop for?
	- What engine will you use and why?
	- What assets will you need?
	- How will the sense of tension you created need to be adjusted for videogaming?
	- What 5 games already exist like this potential project that you'd have to compete with?
		- How will you compete?
