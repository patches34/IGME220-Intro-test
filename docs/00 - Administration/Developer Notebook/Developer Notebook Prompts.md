These assignments are meant more for you than me. You might find them stupid, pointless, or a waste of time and that's fine. It wouldn't be learning if you already knew it or did it. 

**Eternal Caveat:** If you use Generative AI, you have to do this assignment again, twice. You may say to yourself, `that's not fair!` and you're correct, you shouldn't waste your own time like that. This assignment is about you and your perspective. Don't make me fight for you.
# Entry 1

The basis of this assignment is relatively simple. We need to write down ideas, concepts, and thoughts related to design all the time. We might see something in the world that inspires us, we might see games that inspire us, we might see a tweet, skeet, or post that keeps us thinking.

That's the purpose of these assignments. We need better organization and so i'm forcing it on you. The very first assignment has an additional parameter: 

- Select the tool you'll use as the basis of your journal.
  
The normal parameters of this assignment are: 
- Around 300 words based on a selected prompt.
- 5 game design ideas at around a sentence each.
- Reaction to 1 new game outside your comfort zone
	- For your first game, play decathalon in the syllabus. 

For week 1, there are 3 prompts worth exploring in chapter 1. Choose 1 and write around 300 words for it: 
1. Page 8 - Exercise 1.2
2. Page 10 - Exercise 1.3
3. Page 11 - Exercise 1.5

These assignments should be fun to do. If you're finding them difficult or stupid, that's on you as you're missing a chance to think about and do design work. Game design is not simply slamming your face into a keyboard and hoping some roguelike comes out of it.
