# Chapter 4 - Fiction
notes: what fictional worlds are, how they are represented, the kinds of fictions games use (coherent or incoherent), their boundaries. Juul draws on theories of “possible worlds” (from literary theory) to explain how we imagine game worlds.

## how does fiction interact (or sometimes conflicts) with rules? 
notes: for example, the fictional representation may break or ignore some rules for narrative effect; sometimes the fiction is minimal, or the game world is “incoherent.” He also looks at what kinds of fictional worlds are easier/harder to sustain: how details, consistency, player expectation matter. And how game fiction helps motivate the player.

# Chapter 5: Rules and Fiction
notes: tension between rules and fiction. 
--
## Some games prioritize rules, some prioritize fiction; many try to balance them.  
notes: Explores conflicts: when fiction violates rules (for narrative or aesthetic purposes), or when rules constrain fiction in ways that may hurt player immersion or narrative coherence. Also how game design choices resolve or navigate these tensions. 
--
## players have to adjust 
notes: they suspend disbelief, accept inconsistencies, adjust expectations. 
--
## The role of failure, challenge, feedback
notes: this is how the game signals to the player which parts are “real rules” and which parts are “fiction.”

The fictional world of a game can cue the player into making assumptions about the game rules: In a game with a first-person perspective, the player facing evil-looking monsters is likely to assume that the monsters

# Chapter 6: Conclusions
notes: “half real” nature is not a flaw but essential to what video games are.
--
## implications
notes: for game design, for understanding player experience, and for future directions: how video games might evolve, what new forms might emerge, how rules‑fiction interactions might shift. 
--
## origin of critique
notes: understanding these dynamics can help critique games, understand both successes and failures, and inform creation of better games. We move from "fun" to "how well does this game communicate?"
