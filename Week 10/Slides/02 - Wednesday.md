## what is your game?

## how it'll work, and how it differs from games like it.

# WTF is a Sell Sheet?
notes: https://www.leagueofgamemakers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/BoomTown-Sell-sheet-Web.jpg and content: Player count, Time to play, Age range, Components - very important, publishers want to know what this is going to cost them, Genre/category - more than just "tabletop game", Differentiators - why is your game going to stand out in the market? What is it doing differently than other games? A shot of the prototype and/or key game pieces - if you're an unknown quantity it's good to show you have made a physical version of your game because it shows you have been playtesting (you have been playtesting, right?) Game goal - how do you win? what is the objective? This is really helpful and so many sheets I have seen leave it off. Your contact info

notes: don't waste money on bits just yet. Get your game into a workable state so you can start testing art and feel too.

## The end is a print and play file. HOWEVER

## By this point, you're moving into full production and not in this class.

## Our games will be full on print and play so keep that in mind.
