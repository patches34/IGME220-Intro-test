# Moving from Research to Planning
---
## You have some ideas, have a rough outline.
notes: This could be your theme, your mechanic, your emotion but this could've been awful to consider. These things can be tortuous and what's worse, as you go and poke around to see if the idea is viable, you might see that what you've begun to do is awful. The question becomes:
--
## so now what?
notes: This particular moment is rought and weird. How do we move from sort of a thoughtful process to one heading toward pre-production.

notes: So now we just make a game, right? RIGHT? We just get to the end.

notes: There is this concept in computing by folks who don't understand programming thinking with a mental model of moving the giant objects around because they don't understand programming. In game design, as gamers, you've probably done this with regard to the design of games. "It's so easy to fix this game!"

notes: the issue here becomes this. You have a giant ass thing in front of you and that's terrifying. We end up, as first time designers especially, thinking this is simple when the truth is it is terrifying and as we do so, we spin in place.

notes: Our initial thoughts are that it is a conspiracy. This game should be simple and we cannot believe that this is the case. Making a game is ez. ggez. And yet, when I start talking about it to others, I sound insane. So, let me sound insane to you.

# let me embarrass myself a little
--
# I am contracted to make a game.
--
# it is a wargame
--
# but it's for a new branch of the military
--
# and they want to revolutionize wargames
--
# but also don't really know what wargames are
--
# make a game in 8 weeks that changes everything!
--
# and it needs AI!

## Need to combine history of wargaming AND history of mediated games.
--
## First, we play to discover.
--
## Second, we edit our ideas, just sit with your thoughts as a group and just smash words onto pages in a form that doesn't make sense.
--
## Third, we write a turn sequence, a goal, player discussions...
--
## Fourth, we prototype.
