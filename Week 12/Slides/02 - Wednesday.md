I began the day talking about Richard Lemarchand's book: [Playful Production Processes](https://www.playfulproductionprocess.com/) and how we need to learn how we are when we're on a team. 

I mentioned the Fool in terms of Shakespeare in that each team needs this truth-teller and cynic who can offer you criticism from the most unlikely places. In Native American culture, this figure is called a few things ranging from Heyoka to Koyemishi and their job is to reflect the contradictions back to the folks living their lives. 

As a person, I am an encyclopedia is most respects but I can be seen as confrontational as my tenure in the space of academia has me a few steps ahead of most. But when push comes to shove, I am going to follow the leader to their destination (even if they won't listen to me).
___
I then asked students to describe their processes of decision making and the structure of their teams. My expectation was 2-fold: 
1. Folks had a way to generate discussion and get majority rule going. 
2. Folks did not have a structure in place to assert an idea or make decisions related to actually making their game unless there was a strong leader in the group with a strong vision. 

To develop this idea, I asked the following question to get started: 
	What processes are you all using to make your game? OR, how is your team structured?
I also asked: 
	How are you dealing with the pressure of deadlines?

What follows is a per-team Breakdown by order of volunteering. 

**Executive Dysfunction**
This is a game of territory control and majority control meant to promote majority-derived goals to achieve. 

**Structure** - Oligarchy (really, it's a Democracy) - Everyone has a bit of say over everything. 

**Process** is hey, everyone get together and have an opinion. Everyone NEEDS to chime in. "I don't care is an opinion but not preferred." In process, they have mostly agreed but will fall into semantic arguments"

**Results** There is not much disagreement or majority rule, motion carries. 

They believe that their process is "mostly working and is decent for us. They believe they will have a **Playtestable** game by Monday."
___
**Tree of Life**
This game is Nature vs Humanity and they are seeking to balance with each other in a new world.

**Structure**
3 people will share the ideas of a topic and then walk through a bunch of them and dissect them. Will build ideas and groups of ideas until we get a bundle most agree on. 

**Process**
More open discussion. Not learned but have found it through brainstorming and realizing that dissecting each idea is useful in order to create a more cohesive unit. 

**Decision process**
Combination of ways that will indicate that an idea is fully mature. Silence as agreement. 

When ideas are challenged after finding agreement, they will re-brain storm individual components when things aren't working to figure out what aspects aren't working and can then re-dissect and discover. 

**Pressure** 
Under the wire. While brainstorming is effective, it takes more time. If stuck, will table and re-discuss later. They will still be discussing a game idea next week.
___
**Job Hunters** 
Social deception game where they vet folks in the goal of getting them criminals out of there. Sometimes vice versa. 

**Process**
When we have a meeting, we have a lead. If they don't have opinions, that's ok. No pressure. Will listen if they have an opinion. What they could do, how they could do it. "Group discussion but one person leads."

They say they delegate well and it seems to be working. We have people do what they want in order to diminish the tension of deadlines OR, they do what they know so they don't have to learn a new thing.

Folks will sign up with what they know. No unknowns yet. 

**Decision Process**
We will ask the group but some genuinely not care. Is based on past projects where there is an asymmetric need to "Get project done vs Do it the way I want". 

**Pressure** 
Steady Progression is more important than trying to shoehorn people into contributions. One person may be regularly be the lead but if the topic differs, we have different roles lead. This tends to reflect the game design process and needs in different components of the game.
Playtestable Product is nigh. 
___
**Vice Versa** 
Battle your inner demons 

**Structure** 
Personality type design has led to labeling different team members and this has had an impact on the design itself. This is research for the game in addition to seeing the impact. 

**Decisions**
Decision processes are BAD. There are 3 people who are dominating the discussion a lot. Not on purpose but folks have strong opinions. Sometimes go down a rabbit hole and can lead to elongated discussions. 

CAVEAT: Our decision process isn't bad, we just have to get through those ideas more quickly. We need a process of elimination and voting? 

**Pressure**
Our team believes in the agonistic existence of an idea. 

I offered this team that, "While I may have strong opinions, I am not married to my ideas. I'm married to my partner."

They will not have their game ready for Monday.
___
**Miku Capitalist Hunters** 
Fight the man by being a successful indie.

**Structure**
1-2 people throw out ideas and then majority rule. Consensus can be hard because they might not have an opinion and cannot contribute. 

**Decisions**
Have good debates but group probably needs more structure. Flippy floppy. Group procrastination is a thing. 

**Playtestable** object is a far off idea. Chug it out tomorrow night with some red bulls and a dream. 
___
Overall, everyone seems around the structure I would expect. The biggest issue in team-based projects like this isn't about getting along, it's more about making decisions and moving forward. 

And so, that is where I hope you all lead to.
